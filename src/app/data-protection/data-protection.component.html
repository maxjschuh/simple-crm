<h3>Collection of general information when visiting our website</h3>
<h4>Type and purpose of processing:</h4>
<p>When you access our website, i.e. if you do not register or otherwise transmit information, information of a
    general
    nature is automatically collected. This information (server log files) includes, for example, the type of web
    browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your internet service provider, your IP address and
    similar.
</p>
<p>They are processed in particular for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to ensure a smooth connection to the website,</li>
    <li>to ensure smooth use of our website,</li>
    <li>to evaluate system security and stability and</li>
    <li>to optimize our website.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind may be statistically
    evaluated by us in anonymized form in order to optimize our website and the technology behind it. </p>
<h4>Legal basis and legitimate interest:</h4>
<p>The processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR on the basis of our legitimate
    interest
    in improving the stability and functionality of our website.</p>
<h4>Recipients:</h4>
<p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as processors for the operation and maintenance
    of
    our website.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Storage period:</h4>
<p>The data is deleted as soon as it is no longer required for the purpose for which it was collected. This is
    generally
    the case for the data used to provide the website when the respective session has ended. </p>
<p>If the data is stored in log files, this is the case after 14 days at the latest. Storage beyond this period is
    possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are anonymized so that it is no longer possible to assign
    the
    calling client.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Provision required or necessary:</h4>
<p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually required. However, without
    the
    IP address, the service and functionality of our website cannot be guaranteed. In addition, individual services
    may
    not be available or may be restricted. For this reason, an objection is excluded. </p>
